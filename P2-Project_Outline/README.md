# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Collector's Corner app will invite users to build and share collections of movies, books and games. 
Once a collection is created it can be viewed publicly for others to peruse, hopefully get inspired to try out,
and respond with comments. As we develop functionality we are exploring the possibility of capping the number
of items in a collection to a small number of entries and allowing users to curate many collections based
around themes, genres, etc.   

Our goal is for users to enjoy connecting with others who have similar tastes, return to old favorites, 
find new inspiration, and perhaps follow someone else's white rabbit into a another looking glass. 
We will want the builder of a collection to be able to create a title and brief description to attract other 
users to respond. The builder should also be able to edit and delete their collections. 
To aid in collection building, we plan to provide searching capabilities in each collection category involving 
specific APIs. 
### Features 
**Release 1 MVP Features**

**User Authentication:** Users will be able to create a unique profile and login to a user profile page.

**Create A Collection:** Initially, users will be able to add one collection in each category. 
The build your collection page will include connections to an API as an outside resource.

**User Access:** A user will only be able to add/edit/delete items/collections that they have built.

**Guest Features:** Users will be able to browse other user's collections.

**Commenting:** Users can leave a comment as a guest on another user's collection

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Thymeleaf templates
Bootstrap
HTML/CSS
API 
### What I'll Have to Learn
Nick is researching how to connect to public APIs. Other features being discussed by the team would require more 
research: i.e. Making it possible for a user to mark an item as "Available for Donation" and building in capabilities
for a user to "follow" another user's collections.
